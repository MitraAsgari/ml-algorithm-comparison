# Machine Learning Algorithm Comparison

## Overview
This repository provides a comparative analysis of several machine learning algorithms on a common dataset. The algorithms are evaluated based on accuracy, F1-Score, and training time.

## Structure
  - `data_preparation.py`: Prepares and splits the dataset.
  - `model_training.py`: Trains various machine learning models.
  - `visualization.py`: Visualizes the comparison results.
  - `images/`: Contains generated plots and graphs.

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Prepare the data:
   ```bash
   python model_comparisons/data_preparation.py
4. Train the models:
   ```bash
   python model_comparisons/model_training.py
6. Visualize the results:
   ```bash
   python model_comparisons/visualization.py
   
## Prerequisites
Python 3.x Libraries: Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
